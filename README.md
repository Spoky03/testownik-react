# TESTOWNIK
### React, Nest.js
A Fullstack project that I have worked on. It's a quiz app that lets you create and study flashcards. Users can login and see their progess, share quizzes with ohers, browse for public ones, and edit them. App enables you to store your quizzes on the server as well as your progress. It was built with React, Nest.js, and MongoDB. I have learned a lot about fullstack development while working on this project. I plan to add more features in the future.
I plan to deploy it soon.
